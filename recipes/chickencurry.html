        <h3 class="head-text">Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            </ul>      
        <h3 class="head-text">Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in
             the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the browned chicken 
             breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
             <li>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, 
            garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir 
            until the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, 
            cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the 
            onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. 
            Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon 
            salt into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along 
            with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; 
            bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle 
            the garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer 
            pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
