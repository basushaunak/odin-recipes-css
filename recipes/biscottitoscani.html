            <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>

        <h3 class="head-text">Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a large 
                baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 
                vanilla, almond extract, and zest. Combine flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and 
                salt. Stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in almonds. 
                Divide dough into two pieces. Form into long flat loaves about 1/2 inch tall
                 and 12 inches long. Place the loaves 2 inches apart on the 
                 prepared baking sheet.</li>
             <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a light golden brown. Cool
                  on a wire rack for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>With a serrated knife, cut diagonally into slices about 1/2 inch thick. 
                Lay the slices flat on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, turning over
                 once. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Place chocolate chips into a small, microwave-safe bowl. Melt chocolate 
                in the microwave, stirring every 20 to 30 seconds until smooth. Use a spatula 
                to spread chocolate onto one side of each cookie. Let stand at room temperature 
                until set. Store biscotti at room temperature in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
